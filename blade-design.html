          <b>Figure 1:</b> 3D Printed Blade inside of wind turbine testing setup</div>
      </div>
      <div class="proj-text"> This was a group project for a fluid dynamics lab course. 
        We were tasked with designing a wind turbine blade optimized for 
        maximum power production at a specific target wind speed. <br> <br>

        Given that the wind experienced by the turbine would not be 
        constant in a natural environment, we assumed that velocity profile would
        vary in speed according to a Weibull distribution ranging from 0 m/s 
        to 8 m/s. To maximize total average power distribution, we identified 
        the speed that was both most likely to occur and capable of producing the highest 
        theoretical power for a given turbine size. To do this, we multiplyied the 
        theoretical power output, given by equation 1, by the probability of each wind speed occurring. This 
        analysis indicated that the optimal design wind speed was 5.4 m/s.  <br> <br>

        We then performed finite element analysis (FEA) on the initial blade geometry to 
        evaluate yield stresses and deflection magnitudes at the blade tip. Two loading 
        scenarios were analyzed: one under optimal design conditions and another under 
        maximum possible operating conditions. Our analysis revealed that the initial blade 
        design experienced significant deflection at the tip, even under optimal conditions. 
        To address this, we scaled the chord length using a function that increased chord 
        more significantly toward the tip than at the base, resulting in a fatter, more 
        rectangular blade shape.

        For wind tunnel testing, we selected a low wind speed and applied a braking torque 
        to achieve a rotation rate as close to 2000 RPM as possible. We then incrementally 
        increased the braking torque until the blade stalled. Once stall occurred, we 
        incremented the wind speed in steps of approximately 1 m/s, repeating this process 
        as many times as the allotted testing time permitted. 

        Finally, we compared our results to our design conditions by plotting power output 
        versus RPM and power output versus wind speed. While our blade performed optimally 
        under the designed conditions, some technical limitations encountered during the lab 
        testing prevented us from conclusively verifying this outcome. These limitations are 
        explored in greater detail in this report.

      <p>
        <div class="proj-text"> Next, we selected an airfoil for our blade design. We looked for 
        an airfoil with a high lift-to-drag ratio (Cl/Cd). We identified the SG6043 airfoil, 
        which demonstrated an impressive Cl/Cd ratio of 65. Then, to determine the optimal 
        rotational rate for our wind speed of 5.4 m/s, a MATLAB script with power calculations which included nonideal contributions.
        Inputting the SG6043 airfoil properties and testing various rotation rates led us to 
        select an optimal rotation rate of 1250 RPM. For our geometry, we started by ignoring the
        blades

      <h3 style="font-size:27px;">Analytical Modeling</h3>
      <p>
        <div class="proj-text">To simplify the dynamics, the system's motors and camera were modeled as point masses, with the gimbal arms assumed to have negligible mass. Using three non-inertial reference frames (aligned with gimbal arms and the camera lens), dynamic analyses were performed using both the Euler-Lagrange and Differential-Algebraic Equation (DAE) methods.
          Key steps included:
        <ul>
          <li>Deriving equations of motion using rotation matrices and potential/kinetic energy calculations.</li>
          <li>Solving these equations numerically in MATLAB, employing Jacobian operators and the ode45 solver.</li>

        The diagrams above show the three non inertial reference frames aligned with the gimbal arms and the camera lens, which I will be using during this analysis. It also defines the inertial reference frame, centered at the origin. The model may translate in the î direction, and the angles ⍴, ɸ, and Ѱ are free to change. The force F in the FBD will sometimes be present and when it is, the model may translate in the î direction. When F is not prescribed, the system will be fixed at the origin.

        <div class="proj-text">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Balanced vs. Unbalanced Systems:</b> When the CG aligns with the intersection of all axes (balanced), the camera experiences lower forces but higher vibrations. These vibrations, attributed to modeling approximations (e.g., motors and camera as point masses), suggest the need for improved modeling with moments of inertia.</li>
          <li><b>Method Performance:</b> The Euler-Lagrange approach was computationally efficient but less flexible for prescribed changes, while the DAE method supported more complex conditions at the cost of higher computational time.</li>

        <div class="proj-text">Through this project, I learned the importance of incremental problem-solving combined with periodic validation. Breaking down complex systems and verifying results at each step could have streamlined debugging. Additionally, while approximations simplify initial modeling, they can introduce discrepancies, underscoring the need for rigorous validation through refined simulations and experimental testing.
